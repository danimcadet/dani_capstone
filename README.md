### Data Questions

1. **How will programs with high EMIs fare when additional college choice considerations are included?**
    
    The EMI is a useful starting point for understanding how well institutions improve long-term outcomes for Pell-eligible students. However, it does not give insights on any other college characteristic, such as retention and setting. It also does not give enough insight to families who are in the aid dead zone. **In this ADZ, families are ineligible for the Pell grant and any other external aid that uses a similar financial eligibility metric. At the same time, these families’ earnings are not on par with families who can foot the full bill, or at least spend money where it counts for admission.** To name a few: sustaining impressive, but expensive, extracurricular activities over years, attending private schools that are well connected to highly-selective schools, and receiving private college counselling.
    
    Overall, the impact of family income on student acceptance odds varies depending on the school and its admission policies. In general, the higher the selectivity of the school, the more likely family income will play a role in acceptance odds. For highly selective schools, which often have limited spots available, admissions committees may consider a student's ability to pay tuition when making acceptance decisions because they rely more on their endowment than government funding. Students in the ADZ are neither able to afford to pay the full tuition nor do they have the potential to receive substantial aid. **Looking at location is key here because a school’s income cutoff for aid is typically influenced by the cost of living where it is located.** By contrast, for less selective schools with larger class sizes and more spots available, family income may not be as much of a factor in acceptance odds because they often have lower tuition rates and rely more on government funding. **Since less selective schools have more flexibility in admitting students regardless of their ability to pay, these programs are also ideal when looking for a reasonable cost-after-aid outlook.**
    
    *This project forwards an already student-outcome-centered resource into one that is inclusive of more families who struggle to find a financially-responsible route to college for their children. Will schools that do well by their Pell-recipients also support their mid-income students?*
    
2. **Is there a relationship between an institution’s location on EMI?**
    
    **Recent studies show that there is a relationship between the location of an institution and the earning potential of its graduates.** This is due to various factors such as the economic conditions and job opportunities available in a particular location. In general, graduates from institutions located in urban areas tend to earn higher salaries compared to those from rural areas. This is because urban areas are usually associated with a higher cost of living and therefore employers in such areas tend to offer higher salaries to their employees. Additionally, urban areas usually have a more diverse range of job opportunities available to graduates, which can also contribute to higher earning potential. However, there are exceptions to this trend. Graduates from institutions located in rural areas may have higher earning potential in certain fields such as agriculture, natural resources, and environmental sciences. This is because these fields are more prevalent in rural areas and require specialized skills that are in high demand.
    
    *This project explores how socioeconomic status interact with the location of an institution and earning potential. The EMI’s across levels will shape our understanding of this issue.*
    
### Where the Money Resides: Factors Shaping Financial Aid Policies and Decisions

There are a myriad considerations when thinking about financial aid, making it challenging to give general advice. I sought out themes in the data that suggested how families could target schools based on:

1. Initial Aid Potential: Which schools are generally awarding higher aid to students regardless of income?
2. Aid Appeal Potential: Which schools are most likely to respond generously to financial aid appeal letters?

**How much do the college accrediting bodies influence school-level policy? Not much.**

When it comes to college accreditation in the United States, there are seven regional accreditors that oversee different parts of the country. These accreditors are:

1. Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE)
2. New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE)
3. Higher Learning Commission (HLC)
4. Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)
5. Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC)
6. WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC)
7. Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC)

These entities do not offer broad-sweeping policies around financial aid cutoff and allocation outside of regulating ethics and offering best practices. Therefore, it is safe to assume that schools are using other factors to design their financial aid policies.

**Control: Private versus Public**

According to a 2020 report by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), private colleges and universities offered an average of $19,980 in institutional aid per full-time equivalent (FTE) undergraduate student in the 2019-2020 academic year. Alternatively, public colleges and universities offered an average of $4,510 in institutional aid per FTE undergraduate student in the same year. This data suggests that **private schools generally offer more aid than public schools**. However, private schools typically have a higher sticker price. Therefore, this project uses the average cost of attendance after aid to assess how giving schools are.

****************************Endowment Size****************************

Additionally, a study by the College Board found that colleges and universities with larger endowments were able to offer more financial aid to students. **Schools with endowments over $1 billion were able to offer an average of $60,000 in financial aid per student**, while schools with endowments under $100 million were only able to offer an average of $9,000 in financial aid per student. This indicates that larger endowments are associated with higher amounts of financial aid offered to students. This fact is particularly important when looking at families earning over $30,000 because external scholarships, federal aid, and some internal awards have similar low-income/high-need cutoff points; non-Pell students are going to rely primarily on internal awards when their expected family contribution is not enough to foot the bill. The endowment factor is also important to the financial aid appeal process.

********************************School Selectivity********************************

The schools in this pool are the ones we hear about most often: Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amherst College, etc. A 2018 report by Inside Higher Ed found that **more selective colleges and universities tend to offer more financial aid to attract high-achieving students**. These schools are competing with other highly selective institutions for the same pool of talented students and need to offer competitive financial aid packages to outbid other programs. There is at least one other aspect of selectivity that families can consider: program selectivity. Within schools there are also special programs that have special funding pools and/or are selective enough to warrant bidding, such as honors colleges and pre-medical programs.
